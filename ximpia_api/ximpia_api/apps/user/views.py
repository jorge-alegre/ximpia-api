Routes
======

We would define this from front, being some map simple to understand.

/contributions/{contribution_slug:slug_type}/

above is the one to be configured, then we can access with:

/contributions/{contribution_slug:slug_type}/create
/contributions/{contribution_slug:slug_type}/update
/contributions/{contribution_slug:slug_type}/list (these would accept Ximpia queries, input, query_name)
/contributions/{contribution_slug:slug_type}/detail
